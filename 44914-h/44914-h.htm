<h2>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="They meet in front of the fire" />
</div>



<h2>I<br />

<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW</small></h2>


<p>"Get out of the way," said a little
fat dog, as he came near the fire.</p>

<p>"I shall not get out of your way,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
said the white puss, who had got the
best place first. "Do you keep out
of my way!"</p>

<p>"You are as bad a cat as ever I
saw," cried the dog, in a rage.</p>

<p>The dog's name was Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"I am not half so bad a cat as you
are a dog," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew were a
very young dog and cat.</p>

<p>They did not know how to be good.
No one had told them.</p>

<p>They did not use kind words the
one to the other.</p>

<p>They led a sad life, and were cross
all day long.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow said that Mew-Mew was
idle, vain, and cross, and of no use to
any one.</p>

<p>And Mew-Mew said of Bow-Wow,
that he was only fit to bark, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was all for himself and ever in the
way.</p>

<p>Thus they used to go on all day.</p>

<p>It was quite a treat when they fell
asleep. That was the only time that
there was peace with them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>II<br />
<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW ARE NOT
HAPPY</small></h2>


<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew did not
love each other. But you must know
that they did not find good in any
thing.</p>

<p>All was bad alike to them.</p>

<p>They did not like the house they
lived in; they did not like the lady
they lived with; nor the food they
had to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>They said they did not have what
was good for them to eat or to
drink.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow wanted other little dogs
about the place, so that he could have
a good game of play.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew sat with her eyes half
shut for hours, to think what a shame
it was no other cat ever came to see
her.</p>

<p>"Now if I had a real home," Mew-Mew
would say, "I would have a lot
of young cats in it.</p>

<p>I would have a fire in every room,
a cup of warm milk on each floor, and
all the meat in the house should be
cut up into little bits.</p>

<p>And I would kill Bow-Wow and
all the dogs that came near my
house."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2>III<br />
<small>MEW-MEW FALLS ASLEEP</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew would think of such a
life till she grew quite glad.</p>

<p>She would begin to purr, and so
sing herself off to sleep.</p>

<p>"Did ever any one see such a cat?"
Bow-Wow said, when Mew-Mew acted
in this way.</p>

<p>"She sings as if she were out of her
wits.</p>

<p>I have seen much in my life" (he
was quite young), "but I have never
seen so silly a cat as Mew-Mew is."</p>

<p>Then he would go to Mew-Mew and
give her a blow on the side of her
head to wake her up.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew would spring up like a
shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="350" height="340" alt="Mew-Mew chasing Bow-Wow" />
</div>

<p>And if Bow-Wow did not take to
his heels with all his might, which he
very often did, Mew-Mew would use
her paws in such a way as to make
him wish he had left her to have her
sleep out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew lived in
a farm-house.</p>

<p>You shall hear how this dog and
cat were often put out, and how much
they had to bear.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>IV<br />
<small>THE CHICKS, THE PIGS, THE DUCKS</small></h2>


<p>First, there were the chicks.</p>

<p>"They eat all day long," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear them; I wish I might
eat them."</p>

<p>Then there were the pigs.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow did not like the pigs.</p>

<p>For one day he had gone into their
sty to bark at them. But they did
not fear him and did not try to get
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="400" height="297" alt="Bow-Wow with the pigs" />
</div>

<p>In fact, they trod on him till he
was well-nigh dead.</p>

<p>He kept away from the pigs after
that; at any rate, he did not go into
their sty again.</p>

<p>Then the ducks.</p>

<p>If there was one thing Mew-Mew
did not like, it was the ducks.</p>

<p>The ducks made a great deal too
much noise, they did not even know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
how to walk, and they had a very
bad way of going into the water.</p>

<p>The horse and the cow were much
too big.</p>

<p>It was not safe to go near them.</p>

<p>They had a way of using their feet,
which Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew did
not like at all.</p>

<p>The dog and cat had not one thing
which they did like.</p>

<p>The lady was not quite so bad as
the rest. Still she was to blame that
there were not fires in every room,
cups of warm milk on every floor, and
bits of good meat in the dish.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>V<br />
<small>BOW-WOW IS HURT</small></h2>


<p>It came about one day that Bow-Wow
was badly hurt.</p>

<p>He had gone into the barn-yard "for
no harm at all," he said, but to bark
at the chicks, and put them in fear
of their lives.</p>

<p>He had great fun with one chick,
which ran away from him, and flew
up to its perch.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow went after it and made
leaps into the air to get it, and was
just as glad as he could be.</p>

<p>But all at once he could jump no
more.</p>

<p>A large log of wood fell on him.
He felt great pain.</p>

<p>This made him cry, so that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
could hear him half a mile away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="400" height="357" alt="Bow-Wow and the rooster" />
</div>

<p>The lady ran out to see why Bow-Wow
cried so loud. She took the wood
off him.</p>

<p>Then she found that the bone of
one leg was hurt.</p>

<p>A man was sent for to dress the
leg, and Bow-Wow was put to bed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI<br />
<small>BOW-WOW IN BED</small></h2>


<p>As soon as Bow-Wow was in bed,
Mew-Mew came into the room.</p>

<p>She was as glad as she could be to
see poor Bow-Wow in pain.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a fine sort of dog,
you are," she said; "why could you
not leave the chicks alone?</p>

<p>It is a pity you did not break all
your legs.</p>

<p>I wish you had done so.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it will be a long time before
you get about again.</p>

<p>I shall have the nice warm fire all
to myself now."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!" cried Bow-Wow, for
the poor little dog felt very ill.</p>

<p>Then the bad Mew-Mew put up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
paw and gave Bow-Wow such a blow
that it made him cry loud again with
pain.</p>

<p>The lady came into the room to find
out why the dog had called out.</p>

<p>Then Mew-Mew, who, to tell the
truth, knew that she had not done
what was right, crept out by the open
door. (See picture on page 2.)</p>

<p>She took care to keep out of the
way for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>It was only when it was quite
dark, and the lady had gone to bed,
that she dared to come into the room
again, and take her place before
the fire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII<br />
<small>MEW-MEW BY THE FIRE</small></h2>


<p>Bow-Wow was in his little bed.
Great care had been taken of him.</p>

<p>He had not gone to sleep, for his
leg hurt him so much that he could
not get to sleep at all.</p>

<p>When he saw Mew-Mew come into
the room he was in such fear that he
did not know what to do.</p>

<p>She had been such a bad cat in the
day, that Bow-Wow did not feel at
all sure but that now, when the lady
was in bed, Mew-Mew might kill him.</p>

<p>It was a sad case for Bow-Wow.
He shut his eyes, all but the least bit.</p>

<p>He kept them just far enough open,
to see what Mew-Mew was doing, and
then he lay quite still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Mew-Mew gave one look at Bow-Wow's
bed.</p>

<p>"Bow-Wow is asleep," she said. "I
will not be unkind to him again."</p>

<p>Then she went to the fire, and sat
with her back to Bow-Wow, that he
might not see her; and she began to
wash her coat.</p>

<p>This was such a long task that she
soon forgot all about Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time in the
same place, even after the fire had
gone out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VIII<br />
<small>BOW-WOW IN GREAT PAIN</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew had a nice coat, white as
milk.</p>

<p>She kept it very clean, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
washed it for a good many hours each
day.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow used to say, "Why, you
will wash it all away."</p>

<p>Mew-Mew did not mind that a bit,
for she knew that Bow-Wow only said
this when he felt vexed that he had
not a nice white coat.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow's coat was black as coal.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew sat by the fire and washed
her coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Bow-Wow did not dare to go to
sleep, for fear of what the cat
might do.</p>

<p>At last he was quite worn out.</p>

<p>His leg was very painful, too.</p>

<p>After the cat had washed and washed
for an hour and a half, Bow-Wow could
bear it no longer.</p>

<p>He turned himself in bed and gave
a great groan.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew left off washing at once.</p>

<p>"I will groan again," said Bow-Wow;
"I may as well, as I have done
so once."</p>

<p>He did groan again, and over and
over again.</p>

<p>If he were to be killed, he could
not help it, and the pain did not seem
so bad while he groaned.</p>

<p>"Oh! you are awake, are you?" said
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h! yes, I am awake,"
and Bow-Wow gave another great
groan.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>IX<br />
<small>MEW-MEW A NURSE</small></h2>


<p>"Do you mean to make that noise
all night?" said the cat, in a very
sharp way.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I hope not. I wish
I could lose this bad pain."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a bad dog," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"You have a nice warm bed to lie
on; great care has been taken of you;
you have had good food to eat; what
more can you want?</p>

<p>"Yet you lie there and groan.</p>

<p>"As for poor me, all I have to lie on
is an old bit of rug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>I think it is I that ought to
groan."</p>

<p>"I wish you had my leg," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall never hear the last
of that leg now." Then, as she had
no more to say, she went to her rug
to sleep.</p>

<p>But she had only slept for a little
while, and had fallen into a nice dream
about a mouse, when Bow-Wow gave
a great cry.</p>

<p>"Why do you call out in that way?"
said Mew-Mew, in a rage.</p>

<p>"I am so hot," cried Bow-Wow,
"that I think I shall die."</p>

<p>"I wish you were dead," said the
cat.</p>

<p>"Why did you wake me from my
first sleep and let that fat mouse get
away from me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Am I to be kept awake all night to
nurse you?"</p>

<p>"I only want you to take the rug
off me," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! dear!" cried Mew-Mew.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Mew-Mew taking the rug off" />
</div>

<p>But she took off the rug, and put
it near the fire.</p>

<p>It would make her a nice soft bed.
The rug she had was not so good and
soft as this.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2>X<br />
<small>BOW-WOW FEELS VERY ILL</small></h2>


<p>"Well, will that do?" said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not know; I am very ill."</p>

<p>"I dare say you are not a bit worse
than I am; you have not a bad cold
as I have."</p>

<p>"A bad cold! What is a bad cold
to a leg as full of pain as mine is?"</p>

<p>"Oh! there you are! all about the
leg again!"</p>

<p>Mew-Mew went off to her rug, and
was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>She slept this time for a good long
while, and Bow-Wow slept too; but
as break of day came, Bow-Wow made
a very loud cry.</p>

<p>"Dear me! dear me! what is it
now?" said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot bear this great pain any
longer. You must come and help me
with my bad leg."</p>

<p>"Anything for peace," said Mew-Mew,
and up she came and bit
through what was on the leg and
took it off.</p>

<p>"Well, are you all right now?"</p>

<p>"I am better," said Bow-Wow. But
he lay back, for he could not hold up
his head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="400" height="269" alt="Bow-Wow lying back in his bed" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not look to me as if you
would live," said the cat, after she had
had a long look at him.</p>

<p>"Not look as if I should live?" said
Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"No, I do not think you will live;"
and with that, she sat down before
the dog, with her eyes fixed on his
face, as if she meant to wait there
and see the end of him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XI<br />
<small>WILL BOW-WOW DIE?</small></h2>


<p>"Is there anything I can do?" asked
the dog.</p>

<p>"Oh! I do not know of anything.
You must just wait."</p>

<p>Then Mew-Mew shut her eyes for a
little more sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Mew-Mew! Mew-Mew!" cried
poor Bow-Wow, "you must not go to
sleep.</p>

<p>Oh, Mew-Mew! I have no one to
speak to but you."</p>

<p>"It will not help you to speak," said
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"You are much too fond of your own
voice; I have told you that over and
over again."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mew-Mew, so you have. But
you would not have me die, would
you?</p>

<p>I have so many things I should like
to say to you.</p>

<p>What will you do without me when
I am gone?"</p>

<p>The poor little dog gave such a sad
look into Mew-Mew's face, as he spoke
these words, that Mew-Mew did not
quite know what to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>To tell the truth, though she tried to
think that she was very glad at getting
rid of Bow-Wow for good and all,
yet she was not quite sure about it.</p>

<p>After all, she did not know what she
should do without him.</p>

<p>But she did not wish to show that
she was so weak as to care for him; so
when he asked "What will you do
when I am gone?" she said:</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall do much as I do now."</p>

<p>And she began to wash a speck off
one of her white paws.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XII<br />
<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW BECOME
FRIENDS</small></h2>


<p>But poor little Bow-Wow could not
bear this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" he said, "you will go on
as you do now when I am gone?</p>

<p>You will go on just the same,
when you will never have me to
look at&mdash;or to speak to&mdash;or to fight
with?"</p>

<p>Bow-Wow's voice quite broke down.
"Oh, Mew-Mew! you <i>are</i> not kind to
me."</p>

<p>"Me not kind! If it comes to that,
you are much more unkind than I am.</p>

<p>You do not care a bit for me; not a
bit more than if I was a chick or a
pig.</p>

<p>You would not sit up with <i>me</i>, as
I am doing with you now&mdash;no, not
if I had hurt ten legs," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mew-Mew! how can you say
such things?" cried Bow-Wow. "Oh,
Mew-Mew! how <i>can</i> you, and with me
dying!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="400" height="269" alt="Mew-Mew with paw over her face crying" />
</div>

<p>"You would not care if <i>I</i> were dying
ten times over," said the cat. And
she put her paw over her face, and
began to cry.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I should," said Bow-Wow;
"I am sure I should care very much."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mew-Mew, "I do
not wish to be cross with you, now
that you are about to die."</p>

<p>"Let us be friends then," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>Then they were quite still for some
time. They did not know what to
make of being friends.</p>

<p>They did not speak, for they did
not know what to say.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XIII<br />
<small>MEW-MEW SEEKS SOME FOOD</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"How are you now, Bow-Wow?"
she said.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" said the dog.</p>

<p>"Ah! not very well. There is a look
in your eyes I do not like."</p>

<p>"Oh, if it is only my eyes," said
Bow-Wow, "I can change that....
Look at me now, Mew-Mew."</p>

<p>"That is not the same look at all,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said the cat. "Your eyes are as bright
as mine now, Bow-Wow."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not so bright as yours.
No other eyes could be as bright as
yours, Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>But I do feel a good deal better
now, and I think, dear Mew-Mew, that
if I could get a long sleep and some
nice food&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Should you like a mouse?" cried
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"Ah! I fear a mouse would get away
from me.</p>

<p>I do not know how to deal with a
mouse as you do, Mew-Mew, even
when I am well.</p>

<p>I should like some cold meat."</p>

<p>"Well, I will see what I can do,"
said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>Away she went; but the only food
that she could find was some cold pork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="400" height="327" alt="Mew-Mew on cupboard in kitchen" />
</div>

<p>She had two or three bites at this,
to make sure it was good, and then
went back to Bow-Wow with her prize.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mew-Mew?"</p>

<p>"Cold pork: very nice." And she
put it before him.</p>

<p>"Please have some too, Mew-Mew."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not care if I do," said
the cat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIV<br />
<small>BOW-WOW DOES NOT DIE</small></h2>


<p>They both set to work with a good
will. In a very short time the cold
pork was all gone.</p>

<p>"It was very good," said Bow-Wow,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It has done me a great deal of
good. Is there any more of it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit more," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"Well, it cannot be helped. Shall I
try now to go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do, and I will make up your
bed for you."</p>

<p>This she did, and the dog lay down
and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>"I will just give my coat a wash,
and then try to go to sleep too," said
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be sure you call me if you feel
worse, dear Bow-Wow."</p>

<p>The little boys and girls who read
this book will be glad to know that in
spite of all the fright which Bow-Wow
and Mew-Mew had, the dog was in no
danger of dying at all.</p>

<p>He had to stay in bed for a whole
week, and for ten days more was very
weak, and had to take care what he
ate, and where he went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i038.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="Bow-Wow chasing chickens" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet by the end of a month he was
as strong as ever, and would bark at
the pigs and hunt the chicks just as
he had done before.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XV<br />
<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW ARE
VERY GREAT FRIENDS</small></h2>


<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew were now
great friends.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew said that she had saved
Bow-Wow's life when he was ill.</p>

<p>She said this so often, that Bow-Wow
came to think it was true, and
looked upon her as the best friend he
had in the world.</p>

<p>As for Mew-Mew, she grew very
fond of Bow-Wow; she did not like to
have him out of her sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>They loved each other so much that
if you had told them they were once
cross and unkind they would have
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! that must have been some
other dog and cat, it could not have
been we."</p>

<p>But though they were now such
good friends, they did not like the
rest of the world a bit more than they
had done before.</p>

<p>One night, after the lady had gone
to bed, Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew met
to have a talk before the fire.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow was very sad.</p>

<p>"Why are you so sad, Bow-Wow?"
said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"It is the pigs!"</p>

<p>"What have they been doing?"</p>

<p>"I heard them grunt as I came past
the sty!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew talking in front of fire" />
</div>

<p>"But they did you no harm, did
they?"</p>

<p>"They would have done if they
could."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XVI<br />
<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW WILL GO
AWAY</small></h2>


<p>"Well, pigs are no good anywhere,
I own," said Mew-Mew, "but do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
know, when I come to think of it,
I am not sure but that chicks are
worse."</p>

<p>"Chicks are bad, if you like, but not
so bad as pigs.</p>

<p>You may be right, yet I do not know
but that out of the whole set, ducks
are the very worst of all," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>And then he began to groan.</p>

<p>As soon as he gave a groan Mew-Mew
gave one too, and they kept on
for some time.</p>

<p>"I have a good mind not to bear it,"
said Bow-Wow at last.</p>

<p>"Dear me! you must bear it, how
can you help it?"</p>

<p>"I can go away."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere."</p>

<p>Mew-Mew was so put out with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
thought of Bow-Wow going away, that
for a time she could not speak.</p>

<p>At last she said, "Oh, Bow-Wow,
you would not leave me, would
you?"</p>

<p>"Would you not come with me?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that I would, anywhere, to the
end of the world."</p>

<p>"Then we will go," said Bow-Wow.
"It must be a good change, that is
clear; in no place can we be as badly
off as we are here."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is quite clear," said the
cat. "When shall we set off?"</p>

<p>"Now, at once," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVII<br />
<small>SHALL THEY START SO SOON?</small></h2>


<p>"But we cannot get out yet; the
doors are not open."</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Mew-Mew did not
care about getting away, as Bow-Wow
did.</p>

<p>She liked to stay at home.</p>

<p>And on this night she felt that she
must have a long sleep.</p>

<p>So she said, "We must not start
yet, for I have not given my coat a
good wash."</p>

<p>"Cannot you live one night without
giving your coat a wash?" said Bow-Wow,
in a rage.</p>

<p>"I should think not. Would you
have me to go out into the world with
dust and dirt on my coat?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>And before we set out, I should like
to get a thing or two that we may
want to take with us.</p>

<p>Let us have a sound sleep to-night.
We may hope then to start in good
time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, as you please," said
Bow-Wow, who now felt glad, too,
that they had not to leave their warm
place by the fire just then.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i045.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="Both curled up asleep on rug before fire" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>They lay down side by side on the
rug, and went to sleep.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XVIII<br />
<small>SAYING "GOOD-BY"</small></h2>


<p>Next day Bow-Wow went for a walk
round the farm.</p>

<p>First he had a look at the pigs; he
did not go into their sty, but he barked
at them and said:</p>

<p>"I am sad for you, that you can
never get out for a walk, but must be
ever in that sty. Do you not wish
you had been born dogs?"</p>

<p>And the pigs, with a grunt, said:
"Go away, you little dog; we do not
wish to talk to you. Our home is a
very nice one; we do not want to make
any change."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave a bark at the chicks, not
so much to harm them as to bid them
good-by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="400" height="339" alt="Bow-Wow talking to ducks" />
</div>

<p>He went to the pond to get a drink
and to say as his last words to the
ducks:</p>

<p>"Why do you not be wise and stay
on the land? You can come to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
harm here, but I am sure you will take
cold by being so much in the water,
and that may be the death of you!"</p>

<p>But the ducks said: "Quack! quack!
run off, you bad dog. You do not at
all know what is good for us."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XIX<br />
<small>BOW-WOW AND MEW-MEW SET OFF</small></h2>


<p>In the night Mew-Mew had made
her coat quite white.</p>

<p>She stole a roast chick out of the
house, and hid it in the dust-bin.</p>

<p>And she took one or two other things
which they might want.</p>

<p>They did not start till the lady had
given them two meals that day.</p>

<p>At the set time they met at the
dust-bin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="400" height="370" alt="Meeting at dust-bin" />
</div>

<p>"But who was to carry the chick?"</p>

<p>Bow-Wow said he could not, Mew-Mew
said the same.</p>

<p>Then said Bow-Wow: "Had we
better not eat it now? It is no use to
leave it here."</p>

<p>They set to work, and ate the chick
to the very last bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they did not feel quite so fit
to take a long walk as they had hoped.</p>

<p>Still they made their way to the
gate of the farm and out into the road.</p>

<p>"Now we have done it," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have done it," said Mew-Mew
who did not feel at all gay.</p>

<p>"We must step out as fast as we
can," said Bow-Wow, "for I dare say
they will be after us in half an hour."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i050.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="Running off together" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! as fast as you please," said
Mew-Mew; but she wished all the
time that she was back on her rug
before the fire.</p>

<p>So they set off at full speed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XX<br />
<small>RUNNING AWAY</small></h2>


<p>They left the farm by the gate and
got on the road.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow wished to run very fast,
for "I dare say they will be after us
in half an hour," he said.</p>

<p>He did not think but that they would
soon be missed, though he said, "No
one has ever given us much care."</p>

<p>"Our loss," he said, "will make the
lady sad and she will send out the men
to find us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew ran fast,
so fast that the cat was soon out of
breath.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew could run fast for a little
way, but she was not used to long
races.</p>

<p>She had not gone half a mile before
she began to feel quite ill.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXI<br />
<small>IS IT GOOD FUN?</small></h2>


<p>"It is fine fun, is it not, Mew-Mew?"
Bow-Wow called out in great
joy.</p>

<p>He had often run a long race and
did not mind this run a bit.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is fine fun," said Mew-Mew,
two or three times.</p>

<p>But at last, when for about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
tenth time Bow-Wow said, "Is it
not fine fun?" Mew-Mew could only
gasp out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;it is&mdash;good fun&mdash;but&mdash;can
we not&mdash;just&mdash;rest a little?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" width="400" height="261" alt="Mew-Mew resting by side of road" />
</div>

<p>"What! rest so soon?" said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;just&mdash;for&mdash;a little time."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you wish it," and Bow-Wow
stood still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what is the matter with you?
Have you hurt one of your paws?"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;not that," said Mew-Mew.
"We have run so fast that I have lost
my breath."</p>

<p>"That is sad," said Bow-Wow. "I
do not know how you will be able to
move about much in the world, if you
so soon lose your breath."</p>

<p>"But we are not to be ever on the
run, are we?" said Mew-Mew, with a
wild look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, no, not ever on the run.</p>

<p>But there will be a good deal of it.
We must do the best we can."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXII<br />
<small>IN THE FIELDS</small></h2>


<p>"Have you had a rest now, Mew-Mew?"
said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the cat, as she got on
her legs again. "We will not go quite
so fast now, will we?"</p>

<p>"As you please. If the men from
the farm come after us, and take us
back, it will not be I that am to blame."</p>

<p>They set off once more.</p>

<p>They did not keep to the road, for
fear of those who might be on the
lookout for them.</p>

<p>Some fields were much more easy
to cross than others. The best of all
were those of nice soft short grass.</p>

<p>The fields in which the corn had
been cut, were very hard to get over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The short stems of the corn were sharp
to their paws.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i056.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Walking carefully through corn field" />
</div>

<p>The field of large green leaves was
not so bad to cross.</p>

<p>Still it was not nice to be out of
sight the whole time, and only to know
where the other was by calling out
every now and then.</p>

<p>They could not run so fast as on the
road, and though they did stop many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
times to rest, it was hard work for
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>She was short of breath, as you
know. But, worse than that, her paws
had become so large that she could
only just get along.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" she said, "what can
have made my paws swell in this way,
and what makes them so full of pain?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXIII<br />
<small>PUSS FALLS LAME</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew went on but a little way.
She then could not even limp along
any more.</p>

<p>"Well, I did think you could run
better than this," said Bow-Wow, not
in a very sweet temper, when he saw
her lie down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be well soon," the cat
said, "it is only my paws. Oh, Bow-Wow,
do your paws never hurt?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Well, but just look at mine."</p>

<p>And they did look odd, for they
were as big again as they ought to be,
and quite black.</p>

<p>"Have you some thorns in them?"
asked Bow-Wow. "You must put them
into water and wash them."</p>

<p>"Put my paws in water! I would
not do such a thing for the world."</p>

<p>"What will you do with them,
then?"</p>

<p>"I mean to lick them."</p>

<p>"It will take you a long time to lick
those paws white. But if you mean
to do it you had better begin, for we
shall not walk any more to-night.</p>

<p>Let us creep under this corn in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
field. You will not mind if I go to
sleep, will you, Mew-Mew?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no," said the cat.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXIV<br />
<small>IN THE CORN-FIELD</small></h2>


<p>"I should like some food before I go
to sleep," Bow-Wow said to himself.
"I do not at all know where to get
any.</p>

<p>I must go without my supper for
once."</p>

<p>This he did, and was soon fast
asleep.</p>

<p>As for poor Mew-Mew, she had two
hours' good work, before she could get
rid of the pain in her paws, and make
them look white, as they did before
she set out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she made herself into a ball,
and slept well till the sun was up.</p>

<p>I dare say she would have slept
half the next day, had not Bow-Wow
called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Up! up! wake up, Mew-Mew!"</p>

<p>Mew-Mew did her best to get up,
and to keep her eyes open.</p>

<p>She had never had such a day as the
last.</p>

<p>"No time to lose!" said Bow-Wow.
"We must have some food!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mew-Mew, "we will
have some birds. Wait till I have
washed&mdash;".</p>

<p>"Till I have washed my coat," she
was going to say, but before she had
got the last words out, she heard such
a noise, all at once, in the trees
near, that it quite put them out of
her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up to see the cause of
it, and then cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! look at the birds! Oh! dear
me! Bow-Wow! look at the birds!</p>

<p>Oh! look at them! look at them!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXV<br />
<small>THE FIRST MEAL</small></h2>


<p>She had never seen so many birds,
at one time, in her life before.</p>

<p>"Well, I see them," said Bow-Wow.
"Why do you not go and get some,
and not talk so much about them?"</p>

<p>The truth was that Bow-Wow
did not much care to hear about
birds.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew had but to lie in wait for
them and she could get nice tid-bits
for herself.</p>

<p>But Bow-Wow might look and wait,
and as soon as he made a jump, the
bird was sure to fly away.</p>

<p>The sight of Mew-Mew's little feasts
had of old been more than Bow-Wow
was able to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="400" height="318" alt="Mew-Mew hunting" />
</div>

<p>"Why do you not get some?" said
Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will get them," said Mew-Mew,
"all alive."</p>

<p>And she lost no time about it, for
she had two poor little birds in no
time.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow ate one, she ate the other.</p>

<p>"Will you have one more?" said
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if you please," said the dog.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew could get these birds with
great ease.</p>

<p>They had three birds each, and then
as they could eat no more, they lay
down again for a time.</p>

<p>"It is very warm," said Mew-Mew.
"I wish I had a little milk."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVI<br />
<small>THE WORK OF EACH RUNAWAY</small></h2>


<p>"Milk! Oh, you will get no milk
here," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Get no milk!" said the cat.</p>

<p>"There is no milk," said the dog,
"but you can have water."</p>

<p>"I would not take a drop of water
to save my life," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Bow-Wow, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that all the hair on her back was on
end, "we will hope to find some milk
as we go along.</p>

<p>But I want to speak to you. I think,
dear Mew-Mew, that as you can get
birds so well,&mdash;you know how they fly
away from me,&mdash;I cannot do better
than leave you to find our food each
day."</p>

<p>"I am sure, if I can please you,"
said Mew-Mew, "I shall only be too
glad to do so."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bow-Wow. "I
will pick out our road and say when
we shall rest, and where we shall sleep;
and you can come to me at any time
that you want help."</p>

<p>"I will," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"And now let us set off," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mew-Mew. "I hope we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
shall find some milk as we go on."</p>

<p>They went on for a long way, through
the fields and woods, and kept out of
the way of men and boys.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVII<br />
<small>THE BIG SHEEP-DOG</small></h2>


<p>At last, at a time when they had not
looked well ahead, they heard a loud
bark, and saw a great sheep-dog racing
after them, as if he would break his
neck.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h!" cried Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>They did not know what to do.</p>

<p>"We must run up a tree," said the
cat.</p>

<p>"But I cannot run up a tree," said
the dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot help you," cried
Mew-Mew, and she ran with all her
might.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="400" height="475" alt="Mew-Mew running up tree while Bow-Wow faces great dog" />
</div>

<p>There was a large tree close by;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Mew-Mew flew up it, and was quite
safe.</p>

<p>What would poor Bow-Wow do?</p>

<p>The great dog came up. He did not
give Bow-Wow time to speak, but fell
on him, and began to roll him over
and over on the hard ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mew-Mew! Mew-Mew!" cried
he, calling upon the only friend he had.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'Mew-Mew'?"
said the big dog.</p>

<p>And he laid hold of Bow-Wow's
neck, and gave him such a shake, as
if he would shake his life out of him.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew, up in the tree, you may
be sure, sat as still as a mouse.</p>

<p>"Oh! let me go! and I will never&mdash;never&mdash;"
cried Bow-Wow, with his
voice getting fainter at each word.</p>

<p>The big dog had such a hold of
Bow-Wow, that he was not able to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
what it was that he would never do.</p>

<p>"It is all over with me," he said to
himself; and he shut his eyes and gave
himself up for lost.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVIII<br />
<small>BOW-WOW IS BADLY HURT</small></h2>


<p>Just then a loud call was heard.</p>

<p>"Come off, Rex! Do you hear?
Come off, lad!"</p>

<p>The big dog just lifted his head at
the sound, and so gave Bow-Wow time
to get his breath, but he kept him fast
on the ground.</p>

<p>"Come off, you bad dog!" said the
man again.</p>

<p>It was not till he had called a good
many times, that the big dog gave
poor Bow-Wow a last shake, and then
ran off to the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he was quite gone, Bow-Wow,
who had not dared open his lips
before, began to groan with all his
might.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>They were such sad groans, that they
made Mew-Mew's heart, as she sat in
the tree, quite come into her mouth.</p>

<p>"What shall I do? Shall I come
down, Bow-Wow?" she said.</p>

<p>But Bow-Wow would not hear her,
and only groaned more and more.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! dear! I do think he is
dying," cried Mew-Mew; and she came
down from the tree, though she could
but just stand for fear.</p>

<p>"Bow-Wow! can you speak?" she
called out, as soon as she was down.</p>

<p>"Do not come near me," said the
little dog, in a low voice.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXIX<br />
<small>PUSS TURNS NURSE</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew gave a look all round,
and as the sheep-dog was nowhere in
sight, she came to where Bow-Wow
lay.</p>

<p>"Go away! leave me!" said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"Leave you! Never!" cried the cat.
"Oh! my poor dear, dear Bow-Wow!
Why, you are badly hurt!"</p>

<p>"If I am badly hurt you are quite
safe, at any rate," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"You run away, and leave your
friend to get badly hurt, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Ah! but is it not a good thing that
I did run away?</p>

<p>Who would nurse you now if I were
hurt too?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something in that, so
Bow-Wow said no more about it.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew began to run over the
things she could do for Bow-Wow:
how she would put him to bed, get
him some drink, and kill a bird for
him.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow said he would like some
food, and that if he had a very fine
bird, he would try to eat some of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i072.jpg" width="400" height="297" alt="Mew-Mew looking for a bird" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Mew-Mew went off to find a fine
bird.</p>

<p>But go where she would, up and
down, not a bird could she get.</p>

<p>The land just there had few trees.
There did not seem to be a bird in
the place.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXX<br />
<small>CROSS WORDS</small></h2>


<p>She ran up the trees, she hid in the
wheat, yet she saw but six birds in an
hour, and these all got away.</p>

<p>She went back to Bow-Wow with a
sad face.</p>

<p>"You have come back at last,"
Bow-Wow said as soon as he saw her.
"Come! make haste. Where are the
birds?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Bow-Wow, I cannot find any."</p>

<p>"You cannot find any birds?"</p>

<p>"Not one! It is the worst place I
ever was in," and she began to sob as
if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"You ought to have done better,"
said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"It is your work to find food. I
told you so."</p>

<p>"And it is your part to take care
of us on the way, and you have done
that well, have you not?" said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"You have not much to talk about,
anyhow," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"If I have not, I might have had,
for all your good lookout," said the
cat.</p>

<p>Thus they grew very cross.</p>

<p>I dare say they might even have
come to blows, if it had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that Bow-Wow was not able to stand.</p>

<p>After a while they made up their
cross words.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="Bow-Wow leaning against Mew-Mew" />
</div>

<p>As poor Bow-Wow felt ill, they
could not go on.</p>

<p>No food was to be had.</p>

<p>They lay down just in that place,
each rolled into a tight ball, and soon
fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXI<br />
<small>HOW THE RUNAWAYS FARED</small></h2>


<p>They slept the rest of that day.</p>

<p>In the night rain began to fall. This
made them wake up.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow was just able to walk to
a tree, the same tree that Mew-Mew
had used to hide in. The rain did not
come so hard, close up to the trunk
of the tree.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell you
of all this little dog and cat had to
bear, for many days.</p>

<p>Often without food, in the wind and
the rain, and on the cold ground at
night, what a change after the good
home they had left!</p>

<p>Day by day they grew more thin
and weak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Bow-Wow's black coat was all rusty
and dusty; his bones looked as if they
must come through his skin.</p>

<p>As for Mew-Mew's fur, you would
not think it ever could have been
white at all, it was in such a sad state.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="400" height="425" alt="Running from boys throwing stones" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>She used to wash her paws, and
her face, two or three times a day;
she would have done more if she
could.</p>

<p>Once they went near a house, in
the hope that some food might be
given them, but some bad boys cast
stones at them, and drove them away.</p>

<p>They had to run for their lives.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXII<br />
<small>KIND FRIENDS</small></h2>


<p>One night, after they had had no
food all day, they saw a little boy and
girl on the road, and the boy and girl
saw them.</p>

<p>They did not run away at the sight
of a dog, as some boys and girls would
have done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i079.jpg" width="400" height="358" alt="Two children being kind to them" />
</div>

<p>When they saw how thin and poor
the dog and cat were, they took out
of their bag some bread, which they
had left from dinner, and fed them.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew were very
glad to have the food, and would
have gone home with their young
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>But the boy said, "No, you must
not come home with us. We do not
know you.</p>

<p>We have a big dog in the yard at
home. Rex would kill you, if you
came to our house."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXIII<br />
<small>BAD BLOWS</small></h2>


<p>The one thing in their minds now
was, how to get home once more.</p>

<p>They could never agree who was
most to blame that they had run
away.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew said that all the blame
lay with Bow-Wow; and Bow-Wow
said that Mew-Mew was quite as much
to blame as he was, and more so.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew could not bear this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Weak as she was, she made a spring
at Bow-Wow, and gave him such a
box on the ears, that he, being very
weak too, fell right down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="fighting" />
</div>

<p>When he got on his legs again, he
flew at Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>One might think they would have
killed each other on the spot; but they
were not so strong as they had been,
and could not fight long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>After they could fight no more,
they would not speak a word for half
an hour.</p>

<p>Then Mew-Mew, with her kind heart,
said, "I am sure I did not mean to
hurt you, Bow-Wow!"</p>

<p>And Bow-Wow said, "Let us not
think or say any more about it.</p>

<p>It is very sad that we cannot live
without cross words and bad blows.</p>

<p>But what are we to do? How are
we to live?"</p>

<p>"I wish we were dead," said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"We soon shall be," said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"But why did we ever, ever run
away?" asked Mew-Mew.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXIV<br />
<small>THOUGHTS OF HOME</small></h2>


<p>Mew-Mew had asked this a good
many times before and Bow-Wow had
said, "We did it for the best."</p>

<p>To-day he only gave a great groan.</p>

<p>"We had such a good home!" said
Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>"We had!" said Bow-Wow.</p>

<p>"There was food for us at all times."</p>

<p>"There was!"</p>

<p>"We had a fire all the year round
to keep us warm."</p>

<p>"It got too warm sometimes."</p>

<p>"It never was too warm for me."</p>

<p>"There were the chicks in the yard,
that we did not like."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the pigs."</p>

<p>"And the ducks, and the horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the cow. Yet they did us no harm."</p>

<p>"Well, no! I cannot say they did;
that is, if we left them alone."</p>

<p>Bow-Wow did not forget how the
pigs trod on him in the sty.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew went on: "But we gave
up our good home, we left the lady
who was so kind to us, and here we
are with no food, cold, and wet, and
nearly dead. Oh! Bow-Wow."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mew-Mew!"</p>

<p>They each had as sad a face as you
ever saw in your life.</p>

<p>"We may get home yet," said the
dog.</p>

<p>"Ah, if we could!" said the cat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXV<br />
<small>WHERE WAS HOME?</small></h2>


<p>In what way did home lie? They
had gone now to the right hand, now
to the left hand, now to the north,
now to the south.</p>

<p>How to find the way by which they
had come first, they could not tell.</p>

<p>They could but walk on, and on,
and on; and their poor little weak legs
felt many a pain.</p>

<p>"We can but go on till we die, Bow-Wow,"
said Mew-Mew.</p>

<p>They went on, and never knew the
least bit in the world where they were
going.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the sun rose, they
had not the heart to get up at all.</p>

<p>They would lie still, with their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shut, and try to sleep as long as they
could, that they might not think of
their pains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i086.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="Sleeping next to each other" />
</div>

<p>When they had gone long with no
food, they could not sleep, but would
creep close to each other, or would sit
and look at each other in a kind of
fear.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXVI<br />
<small>PUSS FALLS ILL</small></h2>


<p>At last one night came, when poor
little Mew-Mew lay quite flat on the
ground, and put out her four paws.</p>

<p>She said in a very quiet way, "I
can walk no more.</p>

<p>When the day comes, you must say
good-by to me and go on alone."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mew-Mew," cried Bow-Wow,
and he went to her side and sat
down.</p>

<p>The tears came into his eyes so
fast that he could not see.</p>

<p>"I will stay here if you must stay,
Mew-Mew," said Bow-Wow. "I will
stay here and die too."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear Bow-Wow; you may
get home yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"What good would it do me to get
home alone?"</p>

<p>"You could tell the lady how hard
we tried to get home.</p>

<p>I should like to have her know how
hard we tried, and how sorry we were."</p>

<p>"But she will never know it," said
Bow-Wow. "I shall never find her.
I cannot go on alone. I will not leave
you."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXVII<br />
<small>THE OLD FARM-HOUSE</small></h2>


<p>They lay down to sleep. It was a
dark cold night. They crept close,
that they might not feel the cold so
much.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow could not sleep: he thought
every hour would be Mew-Mew's last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>But the hours passed on, and she
still drew her breath in the same
short way.</p>

<p>She was alive when the sun rose.</p>

<p>It had been night when they had
come to this place&mdash;quite dark.</p>

<p>When the light came, what do you
think Bow-Wow saw?</p>

<p>As soon as his eyes were open, and
this was just as the birds began to
sing, he saw, not far off, the farm-house
at home.</p>

<p>There it was; and the sun shone on
the warm tile roof, and on the old
stone walls.</p>

<p>There it was, with the barn-yard
and the stacks of hay.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow knew them every one.</p>

<p>He gave one long look, and then
such a bark, that even made poor sick
Mew-Mew wake.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bow-Wow, what is it?" she
said.</p>

<p>But Bow-Wow could not tell.</p>

<p>Not a word would come from him
save one.</p>

<p>He ran round and round as if he
were wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Home!</span> <span class="smcap">Home!</span> <span class="smcap">Home!</span>" he cried.</p>

<p>Yes, it was home at last.</p>

<p>Mew-Mew could see it. There it
was, the red house lit up by the
sun.</p>

<p>But poor Mew-Mew could not walk
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Bow-Wow ran off to the house, and
in some way or other, as dogs often
will, made one of the men come to the
place where Mew-Mew lay.</p>

<p>He took Mew-Mew in his arms, to
her long-lost home.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXIX<br />
<small>TELL US MORE</small></h2>


<p>But some little boy or girl will say,
"Tell us more.</p>

<p>Tell me,&mdash;did Mew-Mew die?</p>

<p>Did the lady take Bow-Wow and
Mew-Mew into the house again?</p>

<p>What did she do for them, if she
took them in?</p>

<p>Did puss ever get her white coat
again?</p>

<p>And if they both got quite well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
again, were they good or bad afterward?"</p>

<p>I will tell you.</p>

<p>The lady was very glad to see her
pets home once more.</p>

<p>They were in such a sad way that
she did not whip them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave Mew-Mew a cup of warm
milk before the fire.</p>

<p>Bow-Wow had a great lump of meat
with no bone.</p>

<p>Then each of them had a warm bath,
and Mew-Mew was put to bed.</p>

<p>As to Mew-Mew's coat, she washed
it so often, and took such care of it,
that in a few weeks it grew long and
was quite white again.</p>

<p>And I am glad to be able to add,
that Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew were as
good a little dog and cat ever after,
as you and I could wish them to be.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE BOOK</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew</span> is one of the few books
for beginners in reading that may be classed as literature.
Written in words of mostly one syllable, it has a story
to tell, which is related in so attractive a manner as to
immediately win the favor of young children. It teaches
English and English literature to the child in the natural
way: through a love for the reading matter. It is the
character of story that will, in the not distant future,
replace the ordinary primer or reader with detached
sentences, and which seldom possesses any relation to
literature.</p>

<p>The ultimate objects of any story can only be effected
through the <i>love</i> for a story. The prominent point in
this story is development of good character, which may
well be regarded as the highest purpose of education.
The transformation from bad to good traits in the dog
and cat cannot but have a desirable effect on every child
that reads the story. Bow-Wow and Mew-Mew become
dissatisfied with their home and their surroundings, and
ungrateful toward their benefactress. As the story tells,
"They did not find good in any thing." But after
running away and suffering hunger, neglect, and bad
treatment, their characters begin to change. They naturally
come to reflect their mistress's goodness. They
learn the value of companionship and friendship, and
the appreciation of a home. However, the ethical
thoughts in the story are presented without a moral.
The child really <i>lives</i> the scenes described. He has the
emotions of the characters and feels their convictions.
And this determines the worth of a story as an agent
in character development.</p>

<p>The narrative furnishes, further, the proper kind of
exercise for the imagination. It affords abundant opportunity
for the play of the dramatic instinct in the child,
and effects a happy union of the "home world" and
the "school world." The illustrations, drawn by Miss
Hodge, have been planned and executed with considerable
care.</p>
